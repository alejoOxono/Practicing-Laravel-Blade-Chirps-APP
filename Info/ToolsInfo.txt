Creating Chirps

You're now ready to start building your new application! Let's allow our users to post short messages called Chirps.

Models, migrations, and controllers

To allow users to post Chirps, we will need to create models, migrations, and controllers. Let's explore each of these concepts a little deeper:

    Models provide a powerful and enjoyable interface for you to interact with the tables in your database.
    Migrations allow you to easily create and modify the tables in your database. They ensure that the same database structure exists everywhere that your application runs.
    Controllers are responsible for processing requests made to your application and returning a response.


Routing

We will also need to create URLs for our controller. We can do this by adding "routes", which are managed
in the routes directory of your project. Because we're using a resource controller, we can use a single
Route::resource() statement to define all of the routes following a conventional URL structure.
